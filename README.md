# ArcRx
ArcRx (formally known as ArcReaction) is an experiment in the creating of a web application library that recapitulates the Principles of REST as articulated by  [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).

It builds upon the lessons learned from the design and implementation of [ArcReaction](https://github.com/noblethrasher/OkExample/tree/master/Projects/ArcReaction) (which was based on the ideas as articulated in Fielding's dissertation).
